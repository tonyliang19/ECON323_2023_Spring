After those users switch, some of the remaining users will choose to subscribe to the app in a given month (and transfer from the Free user category to the Premium user category). The probability that a Free user who did not already leave the app chooses to subscribe for the next month depends on the monthly price that you charge. If the monthly price is represented by a positive number $p$, then the probability of subscribing is given by $$\\mathbb{P}\\left[ \\text{Free user chooses to subscribe to Premium}\\right] = \\frac{1-\\mathbb{P[\\text{Free user chooses to leave the app}]}}{1+p}.$$\n",
